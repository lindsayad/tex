\textbf{Bio}

Alex graduated magna cum laude from the University of Washington with a
bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 2010. He received his doctorate in
nuclear engineering in 2016 from North Carolina State University where he was
advised by Steven Shannon in the field of low-temperature plasmas. For his last
three years of graduate work he was awarded one of the National Science Foundation's
Graduate Research Fellowships. This enabled a year of visiting research work at
UC-Berkeley under David Graves between the summers of 2014 and 2015. Since
graduating from NCSU, Alex has been working as a post-doc in the Supercomputing
and Nuclear Engineering departments at the University of Illinois, jointly
advised by Kathryn Huff and Matthew Turk. Current work includes development of a
MOOSE application for modeling molten salt reactors as well as expanding support
of the software package yt to visualization of finite element simulation
results. To date Alex has been an author on seven published journal articles and
has presented at eight different plasma conferences.
